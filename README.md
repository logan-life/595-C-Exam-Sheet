## VM math
- Addressable memory = address space * addressability
- Remember 1 byte = 8 bits, hex takes 4 bits
- 2<sup>10</sup> = kilo, 2<sup>20</sup> = mega, 2<sup>30</sup> = giga
- each process has its own page table mapping virtual page to physical frame
- VM/#pages = PM/#frames = pages size = frame size
- Virtual address is split into log(#pages) bits and log(page size) bits
